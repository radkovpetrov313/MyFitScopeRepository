<h2>Project introduction</h2>
<p>MyFitScope is my defense project for ASP.NET Core MVC course at SoftUni (February-April 2020). The website consists of 2 parts (Blog and Fitness). Each part have 
separated area;</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>MyFitScope is a fitness website where users can plan and track their fitness journy.</p> 
<p>In the "Fitness Area" users can choose from multiple workouts, or to create their own Workout Program, by using exercises form the site's database (seed with data by the site administrators), or to create their own custom Exercises (with embedded 
video links from YouTube) and track their Progress (creating records with physical measurements and uploading images, stored on Cloudinary).</p>
<p>In the "Blog Area" administrators are allowed to create Articles in different categories (Fitness, Food and Life Style).</p> 
<p>There is also "Administration Area" for managing user's roles.</p>
